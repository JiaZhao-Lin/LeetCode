## 1D DP

1. use dict to save cache seen result.
	- `result = self.climbStairs(n-1) + self.climbStairs(n-2)`
	- `@functools.cache`


1. At every house we will have two options: rob or skip. it will never make sense to skip three or more houses in a row since we could rob houses in-between. 
	- At the first house, the maximum you can steal is whatever is in the first house
	- At the second house, since you can't steal from 2 houses in a row you should take the max of: 1. the money in the first house 2. the money in the second house
	- Then for any house past the second you must figure out what the maxium amount of money you can steal up until that house is.
	```
	max_2_houses_ago = max_last_house = 0

	for house_value in nums:
		max_2_houses_ago, max_last_house = max_last_house, max(max_2_houses_ago + house_value, max_last_house)

	return max_last_house
	```
