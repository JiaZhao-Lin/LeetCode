## Two Pointers Ideas

1. two pointers, l and r, to traverse from the beginning and end simultaneously. Adjust the l and r based on conditions.
1. two pointers point at two iterables. Check conditions and increment them
1. while l < r: increase or decrease them

1. Start from the two ends, decrease the l and r base on height. 

1. Split nums into three lists: negative numbers, positive numbers, and zeros

1. Sort the list. Loop over the list, search for sum to 0 from two ends by shrinking the boundaries.
